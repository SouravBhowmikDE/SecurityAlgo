Correctness:

- The program produces correct output.

- The program produces output in the correct format.


Style:

- Correct indentation

- Good block comments

- Both files are missing the header. Remember: Each file must have a block
  comment at the top which gives the name of the file, the student's name, the
  assignment, the date, the version, and a comment about what is contained in
  the file. For example:
/**
 * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
 * author: student name
 * course: CMPT 220
 * assignment: project 1
 * due date: August 30, 2003
 * version: 1.3
 * 
 * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
 * type.

Efficiency and Other Comments:

- The program was implemented as a package, this was not part of the
  requirements. In the next programs avoid using packages, please.

- The usage of HashMap may make your program less efficient.
